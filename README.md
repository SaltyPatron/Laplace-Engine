# Laplace-Engine

Laplace itself: one program, `laplace`, built on [Laplace-Native](https://github.com/SaltyPatron/Laplace-Native) and working against a PostgreSQL database extended by [Laplace-postgres](https://github.com/SaltyPatron/Laplace-postgres). The documentation is [Laplace-Wiki](https://github.com/SaltyPatron/Laplace-Wiki), published at <https://saltypatron.github.io/Laplace-Wiki/>; each source under `recipes/` has its page under the wiki's Corpora.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `laplace tier0` | generates tier 0 from the Unicode data and prints its fingerprint |
| `laplace highway` | generates the highway: the types the resources list (parts of speech, relations, concepts, classes, frames, rolesets) and the mappings between them, a perf-cache beside tier 0 |
| `laplace deploy` | makes a database a Laplace database: the database itself if the server does not have it, extensions, content schema, semantics, its tier 0 |
| `laplace ingest` | every source, in the order `recipes/order` gives, each with its own log; what is recorded already is passed over |
| `laplace ingest source \| file...` | a source by its name, or files, through their recipes: decompose on every core, deduplicate trunk to leaf, record, attest |
| `laplace index` | the indexes again, if one was dropped; `laplace deploy` makes them all from the start |
| `laplace text text` | a text's ID, tier, coordinate and constituents, computed here without the database |
| `laplace pull prompt` | the forward pass: the prompt broken down, and the segments and strands its firmware takes |
| `laplace hop text` | everything attested about an entity, by how hard each strand tugs back, and the content that holds it |
| `laplace hop subject predicate object` | the claims that hold the given parts in their places, with `?` for a part left open |
| `laplace translate word from to...` | a word up to its concepts and down into other languages, two lookups |
| `laplace degrees from [to]` | how far one entity is from another over rated claims, or what is nearest one |
| `laplace forget witness` | what one witness attested, taken back out, and whatever nothing holds any more with it |
| `laplace sweep` | whatever nothing holds, removed |
| `laplace fills phrase` | what follows a phrase, counted across every source |
| `laplace status` | what a database holds, and whether its tier 0 is this engine's |
| `laplace tree file` | a file's syntax tree as its recipe's grammar reads it, for writing recipes |
| `laplace bench` | every native operation measured on this machine |
| `laplace model dir` | a transformer checkpoint read as "b beats c given a" (needs MKL) |

`laplace ingest --plan` shows which recipe takes which file; `--claims` prints what the recipes attest, as text, and loads nothing.

## The machine, the deployment, the build

Setting up the machine, building, deploying from an empty server, and the repositories' agents are Laplace-Operations
(`setup.sh`, `build.sh`, `deploy.sh`, `agents.sh`, and `laplace.env`, the one definition of where everything is). The
engine alone builds with CMake as any of the three code repositories does:

```sh
source ../Laplace-Operations/laplace.env
cmake -S . -B "$LAPLACE_BUILD/Laplace-Engine/icx-release" -G Ninja -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=icx -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=icpx -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
cmake --build "$LAPLACE_BUILD/Laplace-Engine/icx-release"
```

## Firmware

How a pull reads the records is not in the program and not in the records: it is a firmware, a file of decisions, one for each human being. `firmware/program.firmware` is the program's own and says what a firmware can decide; `$LAPLACE_FIRMWARE`, or `--firmware FILE` on `pull`, `hop`, `translate` and `degrees`, names another. The same records pulled under another firmware give another selection, and no standing changes.

## Recipes

A recipe says how a kind of file decomposes and what it attests. `recipes/*.recipe`; the format is described at the top of `src/recipe.c`. A recipe with a query is a curated source: what is recorded is the claims it attests and the entities they are about, never the file's own identifiers. A `map` binds the source's identifiers to what they stand for, and each kind of claim says the stock default it enters at.

Queries run inside the parts of a file's syntax tree no larger than the recipe's `unit`, in reading order. A pattern should name a record's parts by position (anchors), not pair any two siblings: tree-sitter checks text predicates after it has matched structure, so pairing siblings costs the square of their number. When a unit holds more partial matches than a query keeps, ingestion says so.
